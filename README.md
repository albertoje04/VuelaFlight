# VuelaFlight

This project is basically made for pure practice as a task during my degree in Computer Science in the university (University of Jaén)

The idea of it is to simulate and create an app, which is VuelaFlight, that will be able to manage all the information of the airports, routes, airlines and flights all over the world. Then, given an information, this app will be able to do many functions, such as getting an airport given his id, calculate how many routes are between two cities, etc. 

It is relevant to say that the project has been coded in C++. Also, there are some files (.csv) where you will find the information needed for the app in order to manage to apply the functions related to it.

You will find all the .cpp and .h files needed, all well as a main.cpp file where I did the last test, checking the functionality of my implementation of a 2d grid, which uses the position of the airports in order to classify them by that parameter.
You will also find some comments on various of the methods that I coded, explaining what they do and how they can be used (though they are in spanish).

Furthermore, this project is made in purpose of studying and handling many data structures, such as vectors, maps, lists, multimap, priority queue, etc. This has given me the opportunity to learn more about the efficiency of these structures and the awareness of the important decission on which one to choose.
